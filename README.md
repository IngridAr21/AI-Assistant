Group 5: Personal Assistant
========

<p>This is the project of group 5 from the University of Maastricht. We developed an application that is a comprehensive NLP tool for summarization and task extraction from conversations, as well as for applying speech recognition.

### Setup

<p> Download all the necessary libraries and models.
Open the main.py file (directory) in the terminal and run the command “python main.py”. 
Once the terminal prints "* Debugger is active!* Debugger PIN: ###-###-###", then run MainPage.java. Press the audio input button to input an audio file (wait for it to process the file, terminal will print "Speech to Text Done!") and then press on Text File to review the text and add names(make it a dialogue), or directly click on the Text File button and write a dialogue. 
Afterwards, pick a summary type and click on the summary button.
For the extractive summary, the input is required to contain speaker segmentation.

Example:

Jack: I want go to the mall.
Phil: I will pick you up.

Once the summary is made, you can pick a todo list type and then create the todo list.
