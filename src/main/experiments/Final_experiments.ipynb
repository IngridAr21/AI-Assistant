      "Sophie: Hello Noah, but of course I am.Thank you.\n",
      "Noah: Actually William went to collect the rest of them for you immediately. They're in a basket on our terrace, so you call collect them any time.\n",
      "Sophie: That's very very kind of him! He's really a darling.\n",
      "Sophie: We won't be going your direction any time soon I'm afraid. How long will they keep? Is it windfall?\n",
      "Noah: Both really but they all look very healthy. No bruises afa one can see. Or only odd small ones. They' be alright for a couple of days I guess. The weather's cool.\n",
      "Sophie: It would be a shame if they rotted. I'll talk to Frank and maybe to the twins too and go back to you asap.\n",
      "Noah: OK.\n",
      "Sophie: Hey Noah, the twins will be on their way from Notts tomorrow afternoon and passing Windfield. Is it alright if they pop in and collect the quince?\n",
      "Noah: Absolutely! In fact anyone can come any time and just take them from our terrace. Of course it would be great to see your twins again. Haven't seen them for ages!\n",
      "Sophie: Well we don't see that much of them either :( They'll be coming home this weekend only because of Alexa's ceremony.\n",
      "Noah: Notts is 3 hours' drive away so small wonder they don't fancy it so much.\n",
      "Sophie: I don't blame them! We're both happy they've been doing fine at college. Everything's absolutely fine. You don't have William at home all that often either, do you?\n",
      "Noah: He gets 5 days at Xmas by way of \"family care\" and 2 weeks off spread over the whole year but never longer that 5 days. They have a strict regime at the academy. But after all these years we've learned to cope with it. What worries me is that he seems to have no time to even think about getting married and start a family of his own.\n",
      "Sophie: The fate of most military I guess. Hugely unfair I'd say. Like being married to your regiment!\n",
      "Noah: That's what it sounds like when he talks about himself! I never hear a girl's name! And when I ask, he gets brusque.\n",
      "Sophie: Oh dear! What could it mean?\n",
      "Noah: No, not what you think! We know from Capt. Broomsberg about their common escapades. Plenty of women but only that sort of women. No strings.\n",
      "Sophie: I never even imagined he might be gay! Surely not. But there must be sth else.\n",
      "Noah: We think he's just so obsessively career-minded. Nothing else counts for him.\n",
      "Sophie: He's always been very strong-willed. And he knows what he wants. Well if I were you I wouldn't worry at all.\n",
      "Noah: You're probably right. But you know I'd love it so much to have plenty of grandchildren around me.\n",
      "Sophie: They'll come, don't you worry! Look the twins will contact you about the quince. Alright?\n",

      "Charles: How can you tell that someone has gluten intolerance?\n",
      "Karen: You can have coeliac disease which makes it impossible for you to digest gluten or be allergic to gluten.

      "Andy: Hello. I have had a good look and have done some tests on the mould in your spare bedroom upstairs and in the dinign room.\n",
      "Betty: Hello Andy. Thank you for that, what are your thoughts? \n",
      "Andy: I think it is caused by condensation, as most of the moist settles on and around the windows.\n",
      "Betty: Why is that?\n",
      "Andy: Those are the coldest areas and therefore where the moist in the warm air turns into water. On the windows its just water, on the walls the moist will allow mould to grow.\n",
      "Betty: So why is it all over the spare room walls, and all around the dining room? but not in other rooms?\n",
      "Andy: Probably because they have external walls which are cooler than internal walls.\n",
      "Betty: so why only that bedroom and not the other ones?\n",
      "Andy: I guess those rooms are most effected as the spare room is next to the bathroom and the dining room next to the kitchen.\n",
      "Betty: But why isnt there mould on the kitchen and bathroom itself then?\n",
      "Andy: I think that is because the kitchen doesn't have external walls and the bathroom has only one external wall and a fan in it. The difference when i measured it between internal wall and external wall is about 4 degrees.  \n",
      "Betty: Does that mean we need new double glazed windows or new wall insulation?\n",
      "Andy: Not necessarily. that would make a little difference but would still leave you with moist air in the house, so it would just settle somewhere else.  \n",
      "Betty: So what would you recommend?\n",
      "Andy: I would install a fan system, or PIV system, which would circulate air to dilute and take some moisture out of the air. It would be installed in your loft and be on continuously during day and night. \n",
      "Betty: That sounds good. would that be sufficient? \n",
      "Andy: If you buy a decent size it will be, but you would also need to treat your walls to get rid of the current mould. That will not go away by itself.\n",
      "Betty: OK, is this something your company can help with?\n",
      "Andy: It is indeed, we can repaint as well if you want. \n",

    "Betty: Why is that?\n",
    "Andy: Those are the coldest areas and therefore where the moist in the warm air turns into water. On the windows, it's just water, on the walls, the moist will allow mold to grow.\n",
    "Betty: So why is it all over the spare room walls, and all around the dining room? but not in other rooms?\n",

    "Betty: So why\n",
    "\n",

    "Betty: But why isn't there mold on the kitchen and bathroom itself then?\n",
    "Andy: I think that is because the kitchen doesn't have external walls and the bathroom has only one external wall and a fan in it. The difference when I measured it between internal wall and external wall is about 4 degrees.  \n",
    "Betty: Does that mean we need new double glazed windows or new wall insulation?\n",
    "Andy: Not necessarily. That would make a little difference but would still leave you with moist air in the house, so it would just settle somewhere else.  \n",
    "Betty: So what would you recommend?\n",
    "Andy: I would install a fan system, or PIV system, which would circulate air to dilute and take some moisture out of the air. It would be installed in your loft and be on continuously during day and night. \n",
    "Betty: That sounds good. Would that be sufficient? \n",

      "Noah: Hi there! The quince we talked about the other day... Are you still interested?\n",
      "Sophie: Hello Noah, but of course I am. Thank you.\n",
      "Noah: Actually William went to collect the rest of them for you immediately. They're in a basket on our terrace, so you can collect them any time.\n",
      "Sophie: That's very very kind of him! He's really a darling.\n",
      "Sophie: We won't be going your direction any time soon I'm afraid. How long will they keep? Is it windfall?\n",
      "Noah: Both really but they all look very healthy. No bruises afa one can see. Or only odd small ones. They'd be alright for a couple of days I guess. The weather's cool.\n",

      "Charles: How can you tell that someone has gluten intolerance?\n",
      "Karen: You can have coeliac disease which makes it impossible for you to digest gluten or be allergic to gluten. From what I've heard, being allergic is far worse because you have an allergic reaction that can be lethal, while being intolerant can make you feel some unpleasant symptoms, but I don't think it may lead to your death.\n",
      "Jack: Why are you asking? Is there something wrong?\n",

      "Monica: <file_other>, <file_other>\n",
      "Karen: I think that you may have a very very light allergy at best, otherwise, you would have known - trust me.\n",
      "Karen: When it comes to intolerance... I know it's very hip to be gluten intolerant, but I don't believe that suddenly half of the population is gluten intolerant. Unless you have coeliac disease, I think you're fine.\n",
      "Jack: My friend was told that she may be intolerant or allergic and she did a blood test - she's absolutely fine.\n",
      "Charles: I may do it as well. I feel weird recently, bloated and I gain weight even though I don't eat much.\n",
      "Karen: But do you feel differently after eating gluten? Jack's right, you should do a blood test first, but you can test it yourself. Stop eating gluten for a month and see if you feel better.\n",
      "Monica: I did the same thing with lactose, I wasn't feeling great after drinking coffee with milk, etc. I stopped eating it and I'm much better now.\n",
      "Jack: But did it happen suddenly or were you always like this?\n",
      "Monica: It just happened, I was all right until I wasn't. I don't know how it works, but it happens.\n",
      "Charles: I think it's the same with me. I was fine, but recently it's a real nightmare.\n",
      "Karen: You should quit eating gluten and see, otherwise you should look for a different explanation. Maybe it has nothing to do with food?\n",
      "Charles: I had a basic blood test and everything's fine. My GP said all my problems are linked to my diet.\n",
      "Karen: It may be, but I'm not so sure. Although, changing your diet and eating healthier can't do you any harm.\n",
      "Monica: You should read the articles I sent you, check the symptoms, and what you shouldn't eat.\n",

      "Andy: Hello. I have had a good look and have done some tests on the mold in your spare bedroom upstairs and in the dining room.\n",
      "Betty: Hello Andy. Thank you for that, what are your thoughts? \n",
      "Andy: I think it is caused by condensation, as most of the moist settles on and around the windows.\n",
      "Betty: Why is that?\n",
      "Andy: Those are the coldest areas and therefore where the moist in the warm air turns into water. On the windows, it's just water, on the walls, the moist will allow mold to grow.\n",
      "Betty: So why is it all over the spare room walls, and all around the dining room? but not in other rooms?\n",
      "Andy: Probably because they have external walls which are cooler than internal walls.\n",
      "Betty: So why\n",
      "\n",
      " only that bedroom and not the other ones?\n",
      "Andy: I guess those rooms are most affected as the spare room is next to the bathroom and the dining room next to the kitchen.\n",
      "Betty: But why isn't there mold on the kitchen and bathroom itself then?\n",
      "Andy: I think that is because the kitchen doesn't have external walls and the bathroom has only one external wall and a fan in it. The difference when I measured it between internal wall and external wall is about 4 degrees.  \n",
      "Betty: Does that mean we need new double glazed windows or new wall insulation?\n",
      "Andy: Not necessarily. That would make a little difference but would still leave you with moist air in the house, so it would just settle somewhere else.  \n",
      "Betty: So what would you recommend?\n",
      "Andy: I would install a fan system, or PIV system, which would circulate air to dilute and take some moisture out of the air. It would be installed in your loft and be on continuously during day and night. \n",
      "Betty: That sounds good. Would that be sufficient? \n",
      "Andy: If you buy a decent size it will be, but you would also need to treat your walls to get rid of the current mold. That will not go away by itself.\n",
      "Betty: OK, is this something your company can help with?\n",
      "Andy: It is indeed, we can repaint as well if you want. \n",
      "Betty: Good point. Could you please send me a detailed quote for the work via email?\n",
      "Andy: Of course, I will have that done by Friday. \n",

      "Nancy: How about you, Vic?\n",

      "Phil: Well, it's intended in a completely different way. \n",
      "Vic: What do you mean?\n",
      "Phil: In my opinion, Twitter is not for interacting like on Facebook, but for getting news fast and from reliable, more or less, sources. You can follow anyone and anyone can follow you.\n",
      "Vic: Still, on Facebook I can share stuff with my friends, join groups and talk about things that interest me. And I don't have to limit myself to 140 characters.\n",
      "Phil: 280. Still, a downside. On the other hand, if people were able to write as much as they wanted, Twitter would get as cluttered as Facebook.\n",

      "Phil: Not for me. I don't post that many pictures online. \n",
      "Nancy: But you can follow people and see what they're doing or offering. There are also companies on Instagram.\n",
      "Phil: I know, but I'm more interested in news and gossip than seeing someone post a picture of their breakfast. \n",
      "Vic: That's not all people post on Instagram!\n",
      "Phil: So, what else?\n",
      "Vic: Depends on your interest. I, for one, like to observe all the fitness accounts :)\n",
      "Phil: And does this motivate you to train?\n",
      "Vic: No, but it gives me hints on what to do and what not. \n",
      "Nancy: What do you think about Tumblr?\n",
      "Phil: What?\n",
      "Vic: Heard about it, but never had an account.\n",
      "Nancy: It's a microblogging website. You can post blog entries, pictures and basically everything you want there. And people can observe you!\n",

      "Clara: Well, obviously, the black students try to break it up and there's also an incident where one guy, Reggie, gets a loaded gun pointed at him by a campus policeman after he gets into an argument with a white student. It may be at another party, though, I'm not sure of that.\n",
