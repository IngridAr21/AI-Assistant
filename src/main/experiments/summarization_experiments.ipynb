      "Sophie: Hello Noah, but of course I am.Thank you.\n",
      "Noah: Actually William went to collect the rest of them for you immediately. They're in a basket on our terrace, so you call collect them any time.\n",
      "Sophie: That's very very kind of him! He's really a darling.\n",
      "Sophie: We won't be going your direction any time soon I'm afraid. How long will they keep? Is it windfall?\n",
      "Noah: Both really but they all look very healthy. No bruises afa one can see. Or only odd small ones. They' be alright for a couple of days I guess. The weather's cool.\n",
      "Sophie: It would be a shame if they rotted. I'll talk to Frank and maybe to the twins too and go back to you asap.\n",
      "Noah: OK.\n",
      "Sophie: Hey Noah, the twins will be on their way from Notts tomorrow afternoon and passing Windfield. Is it alright if they pop in and collect the quince?\n",
      "Noah: Absolutely! In fact anyone can come any time and just take them from our terrace. Of course it would be great to see your twins again. Haven't seen them for ages!\n",
      "Sophie: Well we don't see that much of them either :( They'll be coming home this weekend only because of Alexa's ceremony.\n",
      "Noah: Notts is 3 hours' drive away so small wonder they don't fancy it so much.\n",
      "Sophie: I don't blame them! We're both happy they've been doing fine at college. Everything's absolutely fine. You don't have William at home all that often either, do you?\n",
      "Noah: He gets 5 days at Xmas by way of \"family care\" and 2 weeks off spread over the whole year but never longer that 5 days. They have a strict regime at the academy. But after all these years we've learned to cope with it. What worries me is that he seems to have no time to even think about getting married and start a family of his own.\n",
      "Sophie: The fate of most military I guess. Hugely unfair I'd say. Like being married to your regiment!\n",
      "Noah: That's what it sounds like when he talks about himself! I never hear a girl's name! And when I ask, he gets brusque.\n",
      "Sophie: Oh dear! What could it mean?\n",
      "Noah: No, not what you think! We know from Capt. Broomsberg about their common escapades. Plenty of women but only that sort of women. No strings.\n",
      "Sophie: I never even imagined he might be gay! Surely not. But there must be sth else.\n",
      "Noah: We think he's just so obsessively career-minded. Nothing else counts for him.\n",
      "Sophie: He's always been very strong-willed. And he knows what he wants. Well if I were you I wouldn't worry at all.\n",
      "Noah: You're probably right. But you know I'd love it so much to have plenty of grandchildren around me.\n",
      "Sophie: They'll come, don't you worry! Look the twins will contact you about the quince. Alright?\n",

      "Charles: How can you tell that someone has gluten intolerance?\n",
      "Karen: You can have coeliac disease which makes it impossible for you to digest gluten or be allergic to gluten.

      "Andy: Hello. I have had a good look and have done some tests on the mould in your spare bedroom upstairs and in the dinign room.\n",
      "Betty: Hello Andy. Thank you for that, what are your thoughts? \n",
      "Andy: I think it is caused by condensation, as most of the moist settles on and around the windows.\n",
      "Betty: Why is that?\n",
      "Andy: Those are the coldest areas and therefore where the moist in the warm air turns into water. On the windows its just water, on the walls the moist will allow mould to grow.\n",
      "Betty: So why is it all over the spare room walls, and all around the dining room? but not in other rooms?\n",
      "Andy: Probably because they have external walls which are cooler than internal walls.\n",
      "Betty: so why only that bedroom and not the other ones?\n",
      "Andy: I guess those rooms are most effected as the spare room is next to the bathroom and the dining room next to the kitchen.\n",
      "Betty: But why isnt there mould on the kitchen and bathroom itself then?\n",
      "Andy: I think that is because the kitchen doesn't have external walls and the bathroom has only one external wall and a fan in it. The difference when i measured it between internal wall and external wall is about 4 degrees.  \n",
      "Betty: Does that mean we need new double glazed windows or new wall insulation?\n",
      "Andy: Not necessarily. that would make a little difference but would still leave you with moist air in the house, so it would just settle somewhere else.  \n",
      "Betty: So what would you recommend?\n",
      "Andy: I would install a fan system, or PIV system, which would circulate air to dilute and take some moisture out of the air. It would be installed in your loft and be on continuously during day and night. \n",
      "Betty: That sounds good. would that be sufficient? \n",
      "Andy: If you buy a decent size it will be, but you would also need to treat your walls to get rid of the current mould. That will not go away by itself.\n",
      "Betty: OK, is this something your company can help with?\n",
      "Andy: It is indeed, we can repaint as well if you want. \n",
