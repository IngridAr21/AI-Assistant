p257_004   We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
p257_006   When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
p257_007   The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
p257_008   These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
p257_009   There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
p257_010   People look, but no one ever finds it.
p257_011   When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
p257_012   Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
p257_013   Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
p257_014   To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
p257_015   The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
p257_016   The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
p257_017   Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
p257_018   Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
p257_019   Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
p257_020   Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
p257_022   The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
p257_023   If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
p257_024   This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
p257_025   We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
